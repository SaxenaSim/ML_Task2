## EDA, Pre-processing, and Random Forest Algorithm Implementation using PySpark

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), pre-processing, and a Random Forest algorithm using PySpark on a dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is available in the file [dataset.csv](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:635a2b93-9297-451c-80d5-8062b3322013_9230c113-744a-425f-8a07-e771ec4f155f@unq.gbl.spaces/1712579962125?context=%7B%22contextType%22%3A%22chat%22%7D).

## Notebook

The notebook [Notebook.ipynb](https://github.com/SaxenaSim/ML_Task2/blob/main/Untitled.ipynb) includes the following sections:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and understanding the dataset using PySpark.
2. **Pre-processing**: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and preparing features for model training.
3. **Random Forest Algorithm**: Implementing a Random Forest classifier using PySpark and evaluating its performance.

## Dependencies

To run the notebook, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)
- [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
